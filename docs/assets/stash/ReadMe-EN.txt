👻 Motoko Ghosts: RunCat Self-made Runner Edition 👻

⸻

This is an unofficial fan project inspired by the original design of “Motoko Ghosts,”
a well-known NFT collection on the ICP ecosystem 💝.

I love the unique and timeless design of Motoko Ghosts,
and wanted to enjoy it in a meaningful way while working at my PC.
That’s when I realized: “It would be perfect as a Self-made Runner for RunCat!”
